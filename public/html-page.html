                We can call this a mosh posh of awesome stuff to see now and in the future. Developing
                has become a hobby of mine that I hope to turn into a career in the future. For now have
                fun exploring!

               These are a collection of projects that I thought were fun to build and deploy. 
               Some of these are using Reacts framework and all are hand written by myself. Each README
               file will have the other developers that have helped my projects along by following tutorials
               and following school courses as well. I did attend Kenzie Academy for 6 months during 2020.

               My coding or developing actually started early on in my middle school years. I went to special
               schools for behaior problem kids. I would always finish y assignments early so I would have a lot
               of free time that allowed me on the computer. We didnt have access to the internet but that didn't
               stop my awesome teacher helper from teaching me the fundamentals. He would bring in a floppy disk
               of images and we created a band website together. Taught me CSS only but that was enough to spark my
               curiosity. That wasn't what I ended up doing for a living. My love for cars far out weighed programming
               for me. 2019 I was diagnosed with IBS and PNES. Limiting me severely and in 2020 I went to my first
               coding school, Kenzie Academy. They were kind but man I was not ready for the algorithyms or so I thought.
               I caught on alot faster than I gave myself credit for. Due to my siezures I had to drop out but left on
               awesome terms. I wouldnt know what I know now without them. This is becoming a hobby as well as a 
               career path.
